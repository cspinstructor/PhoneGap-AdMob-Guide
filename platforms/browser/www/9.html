  <h4>9. Adding AdMob</h4>
  <p>
    Add a new file call ads.js to the folder www:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/9-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>You can get the ads.js file here bit.ly/2Uh2BpD</p>
  <p>
    If you take a look at the ads.js file, it contains the test Ads for banner,
    interstitial and rewarded video:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/9-2.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    These test ads are from Google AdMob website: bit.ly/2Z9ijq7 When you use
    these test ads, you are at liberty to click on them to test your ads
    implementation to ensure that they are working as expected. Then, open the
    index.html file and add the reference to ads.js as indicated by the red
    arrow:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/9-3.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>Next, open the app.js file and delete all the functions therein:</p>
  <p><img src="images/9-4.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>and replace it with this code:</p>
  <p><img src="images/9-4b.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    The event handlers are already in the file ads.js. The code in app.js will
    initialize the ads contained in the other file ads.js. Note that AdMob ads
    cannot be tested in the Chrome device emulator, we need to build the apk and
    test it on the nox player.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next step is to push to github and rebuild it with build.phonegap.com.
    Open a terminal, go to your project folder 'C:\PhoneGapProjects\Test'. Then
    type in the command: "git add .", followed by "git commit -m 'update'", and
    finally "git push".
  </p>
  <p>Then, go to build.phonegap.com and click on the button: "Update code":</p>
  <p><img src="images/9-5.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>followed by the button: "Pull latest"</p>
  <p><img src="images/9-6.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    After build has completed, download the apk and transfer to nox player and
    click on the 3 buttons one by one and enjoy your test ads:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/9-7.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p><img src="images/9-8.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p><img src="images/9-9.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    Congratulations! You now know how to implement AdMob Ads. If you want to
    deploy it to Google Play you just need to substitute the ads will live ads
    which you can get through your AdMob login account.
