  <h4>2. Adding JQuery Mobile</h4>
  <p>
    Go to jquerymobile.com and click on the Download button. Then unzip the zip
    file. At time of writing it is jquery.mobile-1.4.5.zip. After unzipping it,
    copy the js folder and put it into the www folder of your project.

  This is what your project folder looks like after copying js folder into the
  www folder:
  <p><img src="images/2-2.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    Next create a css folder inside www. And copy the file
    jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css to it. You can get the file from the unzipped
    folder of jquery mobile. It is located in the root directory:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/2-1-a.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    And this is what your project folder looks like after creating the css
    folder and copying jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css into it.
  </p>

    index.html file by adding the following lines indicated in red:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/2-3.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    Next, save the index.html file and refresh your chrome emulator and you will
    now see a nicely styled message:

  <p><img src="images/2-4.png" alt="" /></p>
