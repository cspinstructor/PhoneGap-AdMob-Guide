  <h4>5. Configuring config.xml</h4>
  <p>
    In order to be able to build an apk, we need to configure the config.xml
    file which resides in www folder. Make the following changes to the
    config.xml file:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/5-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    Instead of typing in all the above, you can copy and paste the contents from
    here: bit.ly/2UJqASB
  </p>
  <p>
    That's all for this lesson. In the next lesson we will upload our project to
    github so that we can build an apk using build.phonegap.com.
