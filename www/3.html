  <h4>3. Creating a basic page</h4>
  <p>
    We will create the basic page structure. The basic structure of a jquery
    mobile page consists of a container called page. Within the page container
    there are 3 sections. The header, content and footer. This is what it looks
    like:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/3-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>And below is the body section of the index.html code:</p>
  <p><img src="images/3-2.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>Next we add 3 buttons in the content section:</p>
  <p><img src="images/3-3.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>And this is what the buttons look like:</p>
  <p><img src="images/3-4.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    That concludes this lesson. In the next lesson we will add code to make the
    buttons work.
