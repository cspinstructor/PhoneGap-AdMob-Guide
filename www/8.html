    Then drag the apk file which you have downloaded from build.phonegap.com
    onto the desktop of the nox player. This will install the apk. You will then

    to run your app:

    You app will run. Click on the any of the buttons to test. You should be
    able to see an alert dialog:

    lesson, we will put AdMob ads and let them show when we click on the
    buttons.
