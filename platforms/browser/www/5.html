  <h4>5. Configuring config.xml</h4>
  <p>
    In order to be able to build an apk, we need to configure the config.xml
    file which resides in the root of the Test project. Make the following
    changes to the config.xml file:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/5-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    Instead of typing in all the above, you can copy and paste the contents from
    here: bit.ly/2UJqASB
  </p>
  <p>You will also need to put an icon144.png in your project folder:</p>
  <p><img src="images/5-2.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>You can use this one: bit.ly/2GleVRX</p>
  <p>
    That's all for this lesson. In the next lesson we will upload our project to
    github so that we can build an apk using build.phonegap.com.
