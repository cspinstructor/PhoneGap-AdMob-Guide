    2048 -validity 10000

    Then, login to apps.admob.com and generate 3 ad units: banner, interstitial
    and rewarded video. Copy the Ad ids and replace the test ad ids found in the
    ads.js file with the live ads id. Save your files, push to github and
    rebuild in build.phonegap.com. But before you build, select the key and
    enter your password to unlock it. Once the build is completed download the
    apk and publish it on google play.
