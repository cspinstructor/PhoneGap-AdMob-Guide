  <h4>6. Uploading to github</h4>
  <p>
    We need to upload our project to github.com so that we will be able to build
    an apk file using build.phonegap.com. So, go to github.com and sign up for a
    free account.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to upload files to github.com we also need to download and install
    git-scm. So, go to git-scm and download and install git. git is a CLI
    (command line interface) tool used to communicate with github for purposes
    of uploading or downloading files.

    Next, create a new repository in github and call it Test. Let your project
    be Public so that you can use github for free. The Private setting is for
    paid accounts. Then click on the green button: "Create Repository"
  </p>

  <p>Copy the line indicated by the red arrow below.</p>

  <p>
    Then open a cmd terminal and navigate to your project folder
    C:\PhoneGapProjects\Test. Then issue the following commands:
  </p>
  <p>git init</p>
  <p>git add .</p>
  <p>git commit -m "first commit"</p>
  <p>
    git remote add origin https://github.com/../Test.git
  </p>
  <p>git push -u origin master</p>
  <p>
    Note that the line "git remote add origin..." will be different for you.
    Just use the line you copied from github above. Also note that there is a
    space between "git add" and the dot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next refresh your github page and click on the green button: "Clone or
    Download". Then click on the copy to clipboard icon as shown in red below:
  </p>

  <p>
    This concludes this lesson. We will be using the clipboard link to build an
    apk file using build.phonegap.com in the next lesson.
