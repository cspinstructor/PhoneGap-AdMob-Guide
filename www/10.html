    Download and install java then open a command line and issue this command:
  </p>
  <p>
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore Test.keystore -alias Test -keyalg RSA -keysize
    2048 -validity 10000
  </p>
  <p>
    If you get the error saying keytool not found, you need to add the path to
    the java binaries to your "path" environment variable.
  </p>
  <p>On my Windows10 machine, java binaries are installed in:</p>
  <p><img src="images/10-0a.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    Follow the steps below to add the java binary path to your "path"
    environment variable:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/10-0b.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p><img src="images/10-0c.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p><img src="images/10-0d.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    After adding the java binary path to the environment variable, you need to
    close your cmd terminal and reopen again. Then go to the folder where you
    want to create your new keystore and execute the command below:
  </p>
  <p>
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore Test.keystore -alias Test -keyalg RSA -keysize
    2048 -validity 10000
  </p>
  <p>
    Replace Test with your own preferred name. After the keystore is generated,
    upload it to build.phonegap.com following the steps in the picture below:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/10-1.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    Next, edit your ads.js file to set "isTesting: false". This will fetch live
    ads from AdMob.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, login to apps.admob.com and generate 3 ad units: banner, interstitial
    and rewarded video. Copy the Ad ids and replace the test ad ids found in the
    ads.js file with the live ads id. Then edit your config.xml file to add the
    APP_ID which you generated from your AdMob console:
  </p>

  <p><img src="images/10-3.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    Note that you can download a sample config.xml file here: bit.ly/2UJqASB
  </p>

  <p>
    Save your files, push to github and rebuild in build.phonegap.com. But
    before you build, select the key and enter your password to unlock it:
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/10-4.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p><img src="images/10-5.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>
    Once the build is completed download the apk and publish it on google play.
  </p>
  <p>
    With that we have come to the end of this course. Congratulations on your
    successful completion! Good luck in your apps business! May you make lots of
    money!
